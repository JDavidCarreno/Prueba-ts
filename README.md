This is a way to practice what i have been learning about typescript the last weeks. I am emulating what there is in this video: https://youtu.be/mNJOWXc83Y4

Using the API provided by https://randomuser.me/.

Here are the steps to follow:

- [] Fetch 100 rows of data using the API
- [] Display the data in a table format
- [] Provide the option to color rows
- [] Allow the data to be sorted by country 
- [] Enable the ability to delete a row 
- [] Implement a feature that allows the user to restore the initial state, meaning that all deleted rows will be recovered
- [] Handle any potential errors that may occur
- [] Implement a feature that allws the user to filter the data by country
- [] Avoid sorting users again the data when the user is changing filter by country
- [] Sort by clicking on the column header
- [] Provide a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application
